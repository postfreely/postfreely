# PostFreely

PostFreely is a clean, minimalist publishing platform made for writers. Start a blog, share knowledge within your organization, or build a community around the shared act of writing.

## History

PostFreely is a fork of WriteFreely.
Thank you Matt Baer for creating WriteFreely and making it open-source software.

## Features

### Made for writing

Built on a plain, auto-saving editor, PostFreely gives you a distraction-free writing environment. Once published, your words are front and center, and easy to read.

### A connected community

Start writing together, publicly or privately.
Connect with other communities, whether running PostFreely,
[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/),
[Firefish](https://joinfirefish.org/),
[Friendica](https://friendi.ca/),
[Misskey](https://misskey-hub.net/),
[Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/),
[Plume](https://joinplu.me/),
or any other ActivityPub-powered software.
And bring members on board from your existing platforms, thanks to our OAuth 2.0 support.

### Intuitive organization

Categorize articles with hashtags, and create static pages from normal posts by _pinning_ them to your blog. Create draft posts and publish to multiple blogs from one account.

### International

Blog elements are localized in 20+ languages, and PostFreely includes first-class support for non-Latin and right-to-left (RTL) script languages.

### Private by default

PostFreely collects minimal data, and never publicizes more than a writer consents to. Writers can seamlessly create multiple blogs from a single account for different pen names or purposes without publicly revealing their association.

## Building

In the main project directory, run:

```
% go build ./cmd/postfreely
```

A `postfreely` binary will be generated in the current directory.

The Makefile is no longer needed and will eventually be removed.

To run tests:

```
% go test ./...
```
